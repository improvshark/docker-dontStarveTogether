# docker-dontStarveTogether
Dont starve together server (with caves)

1. Clone repo and navagate to it
2. Edit configs in the save folder to your liking. put your server token in save/Cluster_1/cluster_token.txt (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=590565473)
2. run:  docker-compose up -d


The srv.sh is old... If I get a chance I will do a little more cleanup. If you have any problems or questions feel free to submit an issue.
